# About me
- 👋 Hi, I’m Preet
- 😎 Ex-tech entrepreneur with multiple exits
- ⏳ Been developing software systems for a better part of the last two decades

## Some wins 💰
- Built and scaled a music streaming e-commerce business
- Built and sold multiple mobile apps
- Worked on complex computer vision projects for sports performance assessment, and a few for healthcare
- Developed large-scale image, graphics manipulation apps for clients across different industries
- Working with XR tech since over a decade. This is a topic where my passion and profession intersect

## And a few losses 😑
- Released a couple mobile games which did relatively ok (Chai profitable)
- Built a social network which died at the cold-start stage (and took down a ton of effort & money)
